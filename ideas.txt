Models:
-ARIMA 
-LSTM
  * Benefits
    * Good with sequential data. Chooses what info is important and can keep it in the network for a long time with its logic gates
    * Can regonize patterns and has the structure of a Recurrent Neural Network, which is vital in trying to predict based off given info
  * Cons
    * Hard time debugging models
    * Difficult in coding logic gates (unless we implement using Keras)
